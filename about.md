I’m **Kathan Nilesh Mehta**, currently AI Lead at **Satelytics** where I advance our geospatial AI capabilities—from data ingestion to model deployment.  
I hold an M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from **Carnegie Mellon University** (2020).

My passions:
- 💡 Building ML pipelines for satellite imagery (Sentinel, Landsat, WorldView, SAR, etc.)
- 🌲 Hiking and capturing mountain landscapes
- 🍳 Experimenting in the kitchen (paneer tikka is my specialty!)
- 📸 Photography and visual storytelling
